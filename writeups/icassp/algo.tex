\section{Algorithm}
This section explains how to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of source separation 
via a sparse coding in the scattering domain followed by phase recovery.


Write down the energy minization problem.

Explain the greedy algorithm

%Common choices are the (non-negative) spectrogram or the the constant $Q-$transform \cite{}. 
%
%Given the observed noisy signal $x$, we denote it's spectrogram as $\bb{\Phi}(x) = |\bb{X}| \in \RR^{m \times n}$ comprising $m$ frequency bins and $n$ temporal frames. $\bb{X} \in \CC^{m \times n}$ contains in it's $i-$th column the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the $i-th$ frame of $x$, $\bb{x}_i\in \RR^{m}$ ,and it is given by, $\bb{X}_i = \bb{W}^\Tr \bb{x}_i$.
